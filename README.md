## Introduction
We proposes a semi-supervised multitask learning framework to overcome the limited data problem for **F**aulty **C**ode **D**etection. 
The framework has two parts including 1) a convolutional autoencoder performing the auxiliary task that is learning the latent representations of programs 
and 2) a sequence-based convolution for the main task of faulty code prediction. Our proposed model is shown below:
